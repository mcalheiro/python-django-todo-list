# python-django-todo-list
This is a to do list web app with CRUD operations. It is based on [this Dennis Ivy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llbtoQTt4qw).

On this application, the users can **login**

Or **Register**, if they don't have an account yet

Once registered (logged on), users are redirected to their **task list**

Where they can **create tasks**, that should be empty at first (or if all tasks are removed)

**View** their tasks

**Filtering** is also possible

As well as **deleting tasks**

And **editing** them

Tasks marked as **complete** will be shown under, so users can focus on pending tasks
